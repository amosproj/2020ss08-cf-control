# This is an example for the usage of $ref in YAML files. It is suited for the create service command.
#
# Remote references that use absolute paths and URL References are not contained in the example. They are used like:
# $ref: 'C:\some\absolute\path\config.yaml'
# $ref: 'protocol:\\domain.com:8042/some/path/config.yaml'
services:
  someServiceName:
    plan:

      # Since this path is relative, the file is opened relative to the current file's directory.
      # The pointer (after the '#') points to an element inside of a sequence. Therefore an according index is specified.
      $ref: 'referred.yml#/plans/0'

    # This specifies an anchor named 'myService'. It can be referenced within this document.
    service: &myService

      # That entry is overridden as soon as the ref occurrence below it is resolved:
      # TODO: you may need to change the path to the referred.yml file
      thisIs: overridden
      $ref: 'referred.yml#/service'

  someOtherServiceName:
    plan: lemur

    # That is an alias. It refers to the anchor named 'myService'. The contents at the corresponding anchor are inserted here.
    service: *myService
